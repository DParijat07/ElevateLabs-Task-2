# Operating System Security Fundamentals – Linux & Windows

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates hands-on experience in **Operating System Security and Hardening** using **Linux (Kali)** and **Windows OS**.  
The focus is on **user access control, file permissions, firewall configuration, service management, and OS hardening best practices**, aligned with **SOC and Blue Team entry-level roles**.

This work was completed as part of a **Cyber Security Internship – Task 2**.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Operating System Hardening
- Linux User & Permission Management
- Windows Security Fundamentals
- Host-Based Firewall Configuration
- Process & Service Monitoring
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Attack Surface Reduction
- Security Documentation

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Kali Linux (VMWare VM)
- Windows Defender & Windows Firewall
- Linux CLI (chmod, chown, ufw, systemctl)
- Process Monitoring Tools (ps, top, Task Manager)

---

## Technical Implementation

### User Accounts & Access Control
- Reviewed system users and privileged accounts
- Differentiated administrator/root vs standard users
- Removed or restricted unnecessary user access

### Linux File Permissions & Ownership
- Analyzed file permissions using `ls -l`
- Modified access rights using `chmod`
- Managed ownership using `chown`
- Eliminated insecure permission configurations

### Least Privilege Enforcement
- Limited administrative access
- Used sudo access only when required
- Prevented privilege escalation risks

### Firewall Configuration
**Linux (UFW)**
- Enabled UFW firewall
- Allowed only essential ports and services
- Verified active firewall rules

**Windows**
- Enabled Windows Defender Firewall
- Reviewed inbound and outbound security rules

### Process & Service Management
- Identified active processes and services
- Disabled unnecessary startup and background services
- Reduced system attack surface

### OS Hardening Best Practices
- Applied secure configuration principles
- Ensured OS updates and patch awareness
- Strengthened authentication and access controls

---

## Deliverables
- OS Security Checklist
- Security Hardening Documentation
- GitHub Repository with Evidence

---

## Security Outcomes
- Improved OS-level defense posture
- Reduced exposure to common misconfigurations
- Strengthened system resilience against attacks

---

## Role Alignment
This project directly supports readiness for:
- SOC Analyst (Tier 1)
- Blue Team Intern / Trainee
- Cyber Security Analyst (Entry-Level)
- GRC & Security Operations Foundations
